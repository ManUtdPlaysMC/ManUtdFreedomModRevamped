# ManUtdFreedomModRevamped #

ManUtdFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the ManUtdFreedom Server(http://diamondfreedom.yolasite.com/). 

This plugin was originally coded by ManUtdPvP, with DarkGamingDronze becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 88 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main ManUtdFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.
